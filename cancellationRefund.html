    <h1>Cancellation and Refunds Policy</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Since NaukriDwaar is a digital platform for job seekers and companies, no physical goods are exchanged. Therefore, there are no refunds or cancellations applicable for any services provided on the platform. Hereâ€™s our policy:</p>

    <h3>1. Cancellation</h3>
    <p>Job seekers and companies may choose to withdraw their applications or job postings at any time. However, no cancellations or refunds are provided for services already rendered, such as posting jobs or applications submitted.</p>

    <h3>2. Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>All services provided on the platform, including job posting and application processes, are non-refundable.</p>

    <h3>3. Service Termination</h3>
    <p>Either party (job seekers or companies) can deactivate or terminate their accounts at any time. However, deactivation does not entitle the user to a refund or compensation for previously paid services.</p>
